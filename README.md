# Frostgate Prover
Collects data (e.g. light client proof or Merkle branches of state/event) from the source chain and generates a zk-SNARK/STARK proof attesting to a valid state transition or event. In practice this will use ZKPlug, a trait abstraction that should allow a zk-agnostic backend design.
